# CIPS-LQR-solution

Run the 'main' file to get a visual representation of the system and its LQR controller values. Adjusting the Q values changes the outcome graph of the controlled system.

x_out renders the outcome for each state variable (x, x_dot, phi, phi_dot) at each time indicated (t_out).

The file cart-inverted-pendulum-system.ipynb contains the deep learning algorithm.
